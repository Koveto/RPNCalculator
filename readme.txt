Project Description

HP-42S is a reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator championed by 
engineers around the world. RPN calculators sell for $400 and higher:
a forbidding price for college students. Our committee will design an
alternative HP-42S calculator that is affordable and reliable. Our 
RPN calculator solution will operate on mobile hardware powered by a
battery and disconnected from external devices. Our committee aims to
construct a RPN calculator engineering students could feasibly use on
exams.
